 1. Question: How can I start with a given coloring and write out the optimum coloring found?

    Answer: 'color' provides functions to write out and read in stable set covers/partitions.
            The file format is similar to DIMACS-format:
            Lines starting with
              c  are comments and can be ignored
              p  followed by the problem name and number of vertices. These values are used
                 to verify that only files corresponding to the same problem data are read.
              s  are followed by a list of integers that constitute a stable set.

           Example:
            c Stable sets from exactcolors on instance myciel3:
            c Syntax:
            c        p <problem name> <node count>
            c        s <list of integers ( = nodes of a stable set)>
            p myciel3 11
            s 1 3 6 8
            s 0 4 5 9
            s 2 10
            s 7

           The optimum coloring can be written to a file using the option '-o filename'.
           The stable set cover consisting of the columns of the root LP can be written using the
           option '-w filename'.

           Vice versa, any covering by stable sets (including colorings) can read in using
           the option '-r <filename>'. The stable sets are then used as the starting columns
           for the coloring LP.
           Furthermore, an initial coloring (i.e. partition into stable sets) is
           generated by a greedy algorithm using the initial covering and used to initialize the upper bound.
           That is, if the covering is already a minimum coloring the upper bound is chosen best possible.
